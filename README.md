# sql-challenge
This project analyzes data using SQL about team members of a fictitious company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. Employment records provided in the form of six CSV files. 

First, an ERD was created to map the schemas of the database. Then, tables were created to hold the data from the CSV files, data was imported from the CSV files into the  database, and SQL queries were created to respond to research questions about the data. 


The research questions are as follows: 

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
